# Markdown Flowcharts
A specification for writing elegant and human readable flow charts with simple text in README.md files

I document a lot of software, and flows are always very helpful. Creating flows in software can be cumbersome, and is often not done for little things. The goal of this specification is to create a way to produce a flow for simple things inline in README files.
